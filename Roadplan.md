For a live roadplan with extra technical details check out the [github projects page](https://github.com/users/yuval-herman/projects/1/views/2).

## Roadplan:
1. Adding a database is one of the first priorities. It will be used to save users, past shifts, and other important data for persistency.
    - Time estimation: 2d
2. Fixing bugs and issues with the backend algorithm.
    - Time estimation: 1d
3. Adding persistency. Currently, the app works as a onetime solution; it saves no past shift information.
The end goal is to have the app work completely independently; it needs to save past shifts and recalculate scores based on that.
    - Time estimation: 3d
4. General UX improvements, including but not limited to:
    - Adding manual override for the table
    - Adding a whole new view for the soldier (i.e., not a manager)
    - Allow interactions between soldiers and table managers though the app.
    - Time estimation: 5d

Overall time estimation untill next milestone: 
11d
